# IP-Forwarder
# simple Java program for port forwarding

# How it works
Surely you all know Ngrok, Localtunnel or Hamachi and the like.

But Ngrok has the disadvantage that it generates IP addresses randomly and with Hamachi
you need to have a person with whom you want to run the service.
But it doesn't work that way with my IP Forwarder.
It is completely free and uses your public IP address to forward the port without using a router.
When you activate the program, it figures out what port you want from the configuration file. By default the port is set to 8080
but you can change this in the config.yml file.

# How to download
You go to Releases then in the latest one you click
on assets and there is a .zip file with everything you need to run the program.

# How to use / How to activate
Open the program files folder and click on run.bat

The program will show you important
Done! Enjoy
